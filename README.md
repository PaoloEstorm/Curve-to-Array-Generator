## Curve to Array Generator

Interactive tool for generating C/C++ arrays with custom mathematical curves.
Supports multiple curve types (parabolic, exponential, sigmoidal) with curvature control and draggable custom midpoint option.
Optimized for embedded systems: automatic data type selection (uint8_t, int8_t, uint16_t, int16_t) and PROGMEM support for Arduino/AVR.
